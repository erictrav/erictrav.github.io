            <div class="col">  To Pimp a Butterfly
            				       <div class="col">A review by: Eric Travis</div>







  <p>Kendrick Lamar is a 28 year old rapper from Compton, California, signed to Top Dawg Entertainment and on March 15th 2015 he released his third studio album To Pimp a Butterfly. Since then the album has received widespread critical acclaim and commercial success so much so, that he has earned eleven Grammy nominations, second only to the late Michael Jackson. So, with the Grammy&#x27s right around the corner I think it&#x27s time to revisit one of the best albums of 2015 and possibly of the decade. To Pimp a Butterfly blends multiple music elements such as, Jazz, funk as well as spoken word poetry, in a way no other hip-hop album this year has. This unique blend of sound  is curated by producers and musicians such as Pharrell Williams, George Clinton,  Dr. Dre, and frequent Drake collaborator Boi-1da. This collaboration serves as the basis creates one of the most compelling hip-hop albums of all time as Kendrick Lamar, on top of this rich production, comes with the best lyrical performance of his career as he tackles the issues of racism, the struggles of dealing with his newfound fame, and his struggle with self-acceptance.</p>
     <p>This album&#x27s themes and messages are heavy and at times dark, this isn&#x27t an easy listen. Justin Charity of complex magazine said it best To Pimp a Butterfly &#x22is, essentially, the screams of an agonized man performing open-heart surgery on himself.&#x22 Kendrick Lamar pours his heart out all over this album, the good, the bad and the disgusting. Whether it be abusing his fame, to his suicidal thoughts Kendrick holds nothing back, and paints vivid pictures of the struggles he&#x27s dealing with on every song. This album is the musings of a young artist&#x27s struggle with accepting himself in what he views as a racist America, but, Kendrick addresses these messages with such precision and a flawless execution that makes it one of the most comprehensive albums in the history of hip-hop.</p>
	<p>In addition to best rap album and best song, with the song Alright, Kendrick Lamar is nominated for Album of the Year. The albums in the category include the Weeknd&#x27s Beauty Behind The Madness, Alabama Shakes Sound & Color, Taylor Swift&#x27s 1989, and Chris Stapleton&#x27s Traveler, now while these albums are great and deserve recognition To Pimp a Butterfly stands above all of these album in terms of thematic excellence and musical depth. An a like To Pimp a Butterfly only comes once in a blue, and for this album to not receive music&#x27s biggest award would be a travesty to say the least. </p>
