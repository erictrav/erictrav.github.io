<p>




  After numerous delays and several name changes Kanye West&#x27s 7th solo album is here. The album features many of Kanye&#x27s usual producers such as Mike Dean, Rick Rubin, Swizz Beatz, Madlib, and Hudson Mohawke but, also new ones like Metro Boomin and Southside. The album also has guest spots from The Weeknd, Kid Cudi, gospel superstar Kirk Franklin, Chance the Rapper, The Dream, Future sound alike Desiigner, Rihanna, Ty Dolla $ign, Chris Brown, Kendrick Lamar, Post Malone, Andre 3000, the elusive Frank Ocean and the enigmatic Young Thug.</p>
<p>The album starts off with  Ultralight Beam, a gospel inspired  song with guest spots from Chance the Rapper and Kirk Franklin, this song features lush vocals from Franklin&#x27s choirs and one of Chance&#x27s best guest verses to date, without a doubt it is the track that stands out above all the other tracks to many listeners and one of Kanye&#x27s best tracks that he has made to date. With the exception of Ultralight Beam this album, sonically, is very much a celebration of Kanye&#x27s music, from songs like Father Stretch My Hands Part 1 that sound like the classic College Dropout era Kanye, to songs like Feedback and Freestyle 4 that sound like they came from his last album Yeezus. Kanye paints a portrait of his career in the style of the man the album is named after, Pablo Picasso. Much like Picasso&#x27s cubism paintings, in which  objects are broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form, Kanye structures his album in a similar manner. Songs like Father Stretch my Hands part 1 and Pt.2  could've easily been combined into one song as well as, Wolves and Frank&#x27s Track, but Kanye decided to deconstruct them and reassemble them into two unique songs. Many of the songs on this album sound like they were reconstructed from other Kanye albums and the best example of this No More Parties in LA as Kanye has gone on record saying that the song was originally intended for his 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy but he decided to scrap his original verse, add Kendrick Lamar to the song and, lay down an all new verse for the song. A song made in 2010 but reconstructed in 2016.</p>
<p>While I can sing the praises of this album for weeks, The Life of Pablo does have a fair share of glaring issues as well. To start off this is easily Kanye&#x27s worst lyrical performance on any of his albums. Many of the verses feel like they weren&#x27t written down before recording them or even thought through before hand. Kanye also, has a slew of lewd, questionable, and otherwise cringe worthy lines, lines like,</p>
<p>&#x22You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich&#x22</p>
<p>make me and many other listeners make me question what Kanye was thinking he recorded the song. While songs like 30 Hours and No More Parties in LA are fantastic showings of Kanye&#x27s great rapping ability too many of the verses on the album retract from these great performances.</p>
    <p> All in all, I really like this album, and it&#x27s an album that I come back to often. If you haven&#x27t already, take a listen to this album and have fun listening to it!</p>
